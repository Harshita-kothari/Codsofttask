# Nova — Stylish Animated Landing Page

A beginner-friendly, modern landing page built with plain HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It features a gradient background, glassmorphism cards, hover and scroll animations, and a responsive grid.

## Quick Start

- Open `d:/codsoft1/index.html` in your browser.
- No build tools, installs, or servers required.

## Customize

- Colors and radii: edit CSS variables in `d:/codsoft1/styles.css` under `:root`.
- Sections: edit semantic blocks in `d:/codsoft1/index.html` (`#hero`, `#features`, `#showcase`, `#testimonials`, `#pricing`, `#faq`, `#cta`).
- Animations: tweak durations in `.revealed` and keyframes in `styles.css`. Reduced-motion is respected automatically.
- Icons: Remix Icon via CDN. Replace with your preferred icon set if desired.

## Files

- `index.html` — structure and content
